## Overview

This application is intended to replace the hodge podge of Excel macros that have accumulated during my data analysis work with Dr. Jordan Renna in the University of Akron Biology Department.
Rather than writing documentation to help he and his lab navigate all of those spreadsheets, dictating the file names and directory structures that they should use, and requring them to manually open third party softwares like
Offline Sorter and NeuroExplorer as part of the process, I figured I would just write an application to make the pipeline more automatic and user-friendly.

Moreover, this project represents a sort of culmination of my understing of Visual C#, WinForms, Git source control and GitHub, the .NET framework, NHiberate, NuGet, InstallShield, MySQL, and more.  My hope is that this project will serve as proof of my knowledge of these technologies to future software companies, even though my formal eduction is in biology.

## Latest Release - v0.2

All versions of MEA Cruncher are available for download on my [personal webpage](http://dan-vicarel.com/?page_id=26).
You can also download the source code and build it yourself (tested in Visual Studio Professional 2013 and VS Community 2015).

**Note that MEA Cruncher is currently in development.  It should be considered unstable and likely to change, frequently and significantly.**

I will use an abbreviated form Semantic Versioning to number future releases.  This versioning system is described in detail [here](http://semver.org/).  As a (currently) lone developer, I only bother with the major/minor version numbers.

## License

I have not yet selected a license for this software.

## Developer Notes

All content under this heading is for my personal reference during the development process.
    - DataGridView sorting causes crash
    - Alphabetical sorting of TissueTypes leads to some weird ordering of types with numbers in the name
