## Overview

This application is intended to replace the hodge podge of Excel macros that have accumulated during my data analysis work with Dr. Jordan Renna in the University of Akron Biology Department.
Rather than writing documentation to help he and his lab navigate all of those spreadsheets, dictating the file names and directory structures that they should use, and requring them to manually open third party softwares like
Offline Sorter and NeuroExplorer as part of the process, I figured I would just write an application to make the pipeline more automatic and user-friendly.

Moreover, this project represents a sort of culmination of my understing of Visual C#, WinForms, Git source control and GitHub, the .NET framework, NHiberate, NuGet, InstallShield, MySQL, and more.  My hope is that this project will serve as proof of my knowledge of these technologies to future software companies, even though my formal eduction is in biology.

## Latest Release - v0.1.0

The latest version of MEA Cruncher will always be available for download on my [personal webpage](http://dan-vicarel.com/).
You can also download the source and build it yourself in (only tested in Visual Studio 2013).

**Note that MEA Cruncher is currently in development.  It should be considered unstable and likely to change, significantly and frequently.**

I will use Semantic Versioning to number future releases.  This versioning system is described [here](http://semver.org/).
